# What are these STLs?

ccs if for Choc Chicago Steno

then r3 etc means row 3 profile

then various parameters used in scad file to create STLs

Changes from previously posted versions are modification to the stem (which goes into keyswitch). When looking at keycap from top down (or bottom up) I made the portion of the stem that intersects the X-Y plane wider along the X axis (the shorter dimension of this scalloped rectangle) and the Y axis shorter. I did this because I had to shave off some plastic on all the stemsm and it was also a loose fit side to side. Your mileage may vary with printer settings etc, so do a test print! Don't print a bunch and then get fed up and repreint them like I did.
